Advertising: Predict Who Will Likely Click On The Ad

Which Customers Will Click On The Ad Campaign: Predicting A Profit Of Nearly 17,000$
The task is to predict who will most likely click on the ad. Let's consider that a marketing company is asking for our insight on whether their ad campaign is generating profit or not. Firstly, we have to understand what constitutes a profit and a loss.

The Buisness Premise
Let's assume that the marketing company spends 1000$ per potential customer which they believed will click on the ad. For each customer that is targeted with the ad campaign and that clicks on the ad, an overall profit of 100$ is estimated. However, if a targeted customer ends up not clicking on the ad, the company loses 1050$. Therefore we can conclude that for each customer that was not targeted by the ad campaign and who clicks on the ad, an overall profit of 1100$ is recorded for the company.
